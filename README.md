# Lattice Chat

> A revolutionary AI chat interface that transforms conversations through visual branching and context-aware interactions.


AI conversations by introducing **Git-like branching** to chat interfaces. Unlike traditional linear chat applications, Lattice allows you to explore multiple conversation paths simultaneously on an interactive canvas, making complex discussions more organized and productive.

**Perfect for:**
- Research and exploration with multiple AI conversation threads
- Creative brainstorming sessions with divergent thinking paths
- Complex problem-solving requiring multiple solution approaches
- Teams collaborating on AI-assisted projects
- Anyone who wants to maximize AI conversation potential

**Key Philosophy:** Transform linear conversations into visual conversation trees where every response can branch into new exploration paths.
